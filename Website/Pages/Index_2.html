    <h2>Why is it important to keep warm?</h2>
    <p>
        Does purposely not wearing warm clothes in cold 
        climate increase your tolerance for the cold? While people 
        who live in colder climates have a higher tolerance for the cold, 
        everyone should do what they can to keep their bodies at a stable 
        tempurature. This will help prevent colds, viruses and infections. 
        Further, it will help your body's immune system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most effective way to stay warm is by layering your clothes. 
        To layer efficiently, one should start with the lighter layers and
        finish with the heavier, thicker ones. Layering is also efficient becuase
        if there is a change in weather (for example going inside), you can
        shed the neccessary layers to stabilize your body's tempurature.
